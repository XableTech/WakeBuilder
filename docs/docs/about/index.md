## Project Goals

WakeBuilder was created with these goals in mind:

### Privacy First

All processing happens locally. Your voice data never leaves your machine.

### Accessibility

No machine learning expertise required. The web interface guides you through training.

### Few-Shot Learning

Create effective models from just 1-5 voice recordings using transfer learning.

### Open Source

Apache 2.0 license allows both personal and commercial use.
